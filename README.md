C. Menzen, M. Kok and K. Batselier: Square-root tensor-networked Kalman filter for online Gaussian process regression

For reproducibility of the experiments, run 

- 1_Equivalence.jl   for synthetic experiment with square approximation of square root covariance factor
- 2_Rankinfluence.jl  for nonlinear system identification on benchmark data set with square approximation
- 3_CascadedTanks.jl    for nonlinear system identification on benchmark data with TNKF by Batselier et al.
